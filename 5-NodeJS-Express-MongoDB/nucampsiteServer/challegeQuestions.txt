Do you truly understand what this does? Make sure that you do by researching these few lines of code. Do extensive research and answer these questions before moving forward.



Challenge #1:  What is the function split doing? What does split return? Research the function online.
Answer: The split() method is used to split a string into an array of substrings, and returns the new array.

Challenge #2: Why do we use (' ') in the first "split"? Why use [1]?
* it splits the basic from the base64 string using the space as the separator.
* uses [1] for the password auth.

Challenge #3: Why is the function Buffer used, what does "base64" do?
* Buffer objects are used to represent a fixed-length sequence of bytes.
* Base64 encoding is a way to convert data (typically binary) into the ASCII character set.

Challenge #4: Why is .toString() used?
* To return the value of a String object.

Challenge #5: Why is .split(':') used?
* The split() method is used to split a string into an array of substrings, and returns the new array. The split() method uses the ':' as the separator.

Final Challenge:  What is the type of the variable auth at the end of this code sequence? What's inside the variable auth at the end?
* Array that contains two strings of username and password
